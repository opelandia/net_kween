  Other than social media is there really any space in which gay/queer individuals can see images and read the words of others who identify similarly?  Looking at the gay community at large but more to the youth in rural areas living in fear of what people around them would feel about their real identities. Closeted teens that use the internet to find their first images of gay men in google searches and sneaking around on the computer having their first closeted look at gay culture. This place is your safe space.
